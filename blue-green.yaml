#spec:
#  type: NodePort #ClusterIP #allows pods to talk internally within cluster only

#NodePort opens another port on the node, through which traffic can be redirected
# to the port on which the service is listening ie. 80
# This in turn, will forward the traffic to the target port of Pods with matching selectors

#  ports:
#    - port: 2346 #port to talk to the servie within the cluster
#      targetPort: 8080 #target port where Pods are listening
#  selector:
#    app: blue-green # all the Pods with app label as blue-green will be served by the service
#    # so sometimes blue pod get served, and sometimes green pod
